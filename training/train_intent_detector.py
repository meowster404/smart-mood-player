# Explain how the intent detector works
print("""
The intent detector is a rule-based system that uses keywords and regular expressions to identify user intents.
It does not require a machine learning model to be trained.

The intents are defined in `data/intent.json`, which contains patterns and keywords for different intents such as:
- Greeting
- Asking questions
- Requesting songs by artist or title
- Requesting songs for a specific activity (e.g., study, workout)

The `utils/intent_detector.py` script contains the logic to match user input against these predefined patterns.
Therefore, no training is necessary for this component.
